## Load libraries
```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
library(dfstools)
library(gt)
```

## Game predictions
```{r}
regular_season_schedule <- dfstools::bdb_wnba_schedule(
  "~/DFS/NBAStuffer_WNBA/2019_WNBA_Regular_Season_Original_Schedule.xlsx"
)
this_week <- regular_season_schedule %>% 
  dplyr::filter(
    game_start_time > '2019-07-06',
    game_start_time < '2019-07-13'
  )
season_team_feed <- dfstools::bdb_wnba_team(

)
game_score_projections <- augmented_schedule %>%
  dplyr::semi_join(this_week) %>% 
  dplyr::select(
    `Game Start (EDT)` = game_start_time,
    "Road Team" = road_team,
    "Home Team" = home_team,
    "Projected Road Score" = road_team_score_p,

## DFS data wrangling
```{r message=FALSE}
season_dfs_feed <- dfstools::bdb_wnba_dfs(
  "~/Dropbox/19-wnba-dfs/07-05-2019-wnba-season-dfs-feed.xlsx"
) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(fanduel_salary), !is.na(draftkings_salary))

# tidy DFS feed
season_dfs_feed <- season_dfs_feed %>% dplyr::filter(
  !is.na(fanduel_salary),
  !is.na(draftkings_salary),
  minutes > 0,
  fanduel_points > 0,
  draftkings_points > 0
) %>% dplyr::mutate(
  fanduel_value = 1000 * fanduel_points / fanduel_salary,
  draftkings_value = 1000 * draftkings_points / draftkings_salary
)

last_game_played <- season_dfs_feed %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(player_name, own_team) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(games = n(), last_game = max(game_date)) %>% 
  ungroup()

# who's playing where?
road_players <- this_week %>% 
  dplyr::left_join(last_game_played, by = c("road_team" = "own_team")) %>%
  dplyr::select(player_name, opp_team = home_team, game_start_time) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(venue_r_h = "Road")
home_players <- this_week %>% 
  dplyr::left_join(last_game_played, by = c("home_team" = "own_team")) %>%
  dplyr::select(player_name, opp_team = road_team, game_start_time) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(venue_r_h = "Home")
to_project <- dplyr::bind_rows(road_players, home_players)

```

## Build models
```{r}
minutes_training <- season_dfs_feed %>% 
  dplyr::select(player_name, opp_team, venue_r_h, minutes)
minutes_glmodel <- stats::glm(
  minutes ~ player_name + opp_team + venue_r_h - 1,
  data = minutes_training, family = gaussian
)

fanduel_training <- season_dfs_feed %>% 
  dplyr::select(player_name, opp_team, venue_r_h, fanduel_points)
fanduel_glmodel <- stats::glm(
  fanduel_points ~ player_name + opp_team + venue_r_h - 1, 
  data = fanduel_training, family = quasipoisson
)

draftkings_training <- season_dfs_feed %>% 
  dplyr::select(player_name, opp_team, venue_r_h, draftkings_points)
draftkings_glmodel <- stats::glm(
  draftkings_points ~ player_name + opp_team + venue_r_h - 1, 
  data = draftkings_training, family = quasipoisson
)

```

## Projections
```{r}
dfs_projections <- to_project %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
    projected_minutes = round(predict(
      minutes_glmodel, newdata = to_project, type = "response"), 2),
    projected_fanduel_points = round(predict(
      fanduel_glmodel, newdata = to_project, type = "response"), 2),
    projected_draftkings_points = round(predict(
      draftkings_glmodel, newdata = to_project, type = "response"), 2)
  ) %>% 
  dplyr::left_join(last_game_played) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    game_slug = ifelse(
      venue_r_h == "Home",
      paste0(opp_team, " @ ", own_team),
      paste0(own_team, " @ ", opp_team)
    ),
    game_date = strftime(game_start_time, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
  ) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(game_date, desc(projected_fanduel_points))

```
