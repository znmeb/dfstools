## Load libraries and data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
wnba_data <- bind_rows(
  dfstools::player_box_score(
    "~/DFS/NBAStuffer_WNBA/WNBA-2018-Player-BoxScore-Dataset.xlsx") %>% 
  filter(data_set == "2018 Regular Season")
)


```

## Prepare archetypal analysis input
We select a subset of the box score variables - those used to compute 
fantasy points, plus minutes and games. Then we sum those over each
season for each player.
```{r}
player_totals <- wnba_data %>% 
  mutate(player_name = paste0(data_set, " | ", player_full_name)) %>% 
  select(
    player_name, tot, x3p, a, st, to, bl, pts, ddbl, tdbl, min, games) %>% 
  group_by(player_name) %>% 
  summarize_if(is.numeric, sum) %>% 
  ungroup()
player_labels <- player_totals %>% select(player_name)

```

## Compute the three-archetype model
```{r}
archetypal_analysis <- dfstools::compute_archetypes(
  player_totals, player_labels, num_archetypes = 3)
player_alphas <- archetypal_analysis[["player_alphas"]]

```

## Top Twelve Overall
```{r}
dfstools::ternary_plot(
  player_alphas %>% top_n(12, -Bench), 
  plot_title = "2018 WNBA Top Twelve")

```

## Top Twelve Rim Protectors
```{r}
dfstools::ternary_plot(
  player_alphas %>% top_n(12, `Rim\nProtection`), 
  plot_title = "2018 WNBA Top Twelve Rim Protectors")

```

## Top Twelve Floor Spacers
```{r}
dfstools::ternary_plot(
  player_alphas %>% top_n(12, `Floor\nSpacing`), 
  plot_title = "2018 WNBA Top Twelve Floor Spacers")

```
