## Acquiring the schedule
There are two functions in `dfstools` that can acquire the WNBA 2020 schedule:

* `dfstools::wnba_2020_schedule_bbref(season)` -- fetch from
<https://www.basketball-reference.com/wnba/>
* `dfstools::wnba_2020_schedule_wnba(season)` -- fetch from
<https://stats.wnba.com>

In either case, `season` is the season we want, `2020`. I'll use the WNBA site
for the remainder of this vignette.

```{r}
wnba_2020_schedule <- dfstools::wnba_2020_schedule_wnba()
```
